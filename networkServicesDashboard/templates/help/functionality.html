				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>
					Welcome to the Network Services Dashboard. This dashboard aims to provide a simple, smooth and fast engagement process for supported services.
					<br /><br />
					These currently include:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="">DMZ as a Service (DMZaaS)</a></li>
						<li><a href="">IT as a Carrier (ITaaC)</a></li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>DMZaaS</h2>

				<p>
					This part of the application tracks all of the DMZaaS engagements and clients. This is accomplished using three tables.
					<ol>
						<li>In Progress Clients</li>
						<li>In Service Clients</li>
						<li>Widthdrawn Clients</li>
					</ol>

					Each of these are slightly different but the main principle remains the same. <br /><br />

					There are a number of columns providing information:<br /><br />

					<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
						<thead>
							<th>Column</th>

						</thead>
						<tbody>
